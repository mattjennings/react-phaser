A Scene is required to render components into your game. Typically Scenes are used as levels, or stages, for your game; however,
you can render more than one at a time if you wish.

Every Scene requires a `sceneKey` which should be a unique identifier. If you have textures or other assets that are used in the scene
you can load them with the `onPreload` prop.

<Playground>
  <Game width={400} height={400}>
    <Scene
      sceneKey="main"
      onPreload={(scene) => {
        scene.load.image('mushroom', '/images/mushroom.png')
      }}
    >
      <Sprite x={200} y={200} texture="mushroom" />
    </Scene>
  </Game>
</Playground>

## Loading Screens

You can render a custom loading screen with the `renderLoading` prop while your assets load

<Playground>
  <Game width={400} height={400}>
    <Scene
      sceneKey="main"
      onPreload={(scene) => {
        scene.load.image('mushroom', '/images/mushroom.png')
      }}
      renderLoading={(progress) => (
        <Text
          x={150}
          y={150}
          text={`Loading... ${Math.round(progress * 100)}%`}
          color="white"
        />
      )}
    >
      <Sprite x={200} y={200} texture="mushroom" />
    </Scene>
  </Game>
</Playground>
