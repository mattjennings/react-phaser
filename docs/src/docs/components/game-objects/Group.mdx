Groups can be used to manage multiple game objects together and apply common props to their children.

It may make more sense to group game objects by your own React components and share props that way. The Group component
is the implementation of [Phaser Groups](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.GameObjects.Group.html),
but I am not yet sure if they make sense in a React world.

<Playground>
  <Game width={400} height={400}>
    <Scene sceneKey="main">
      <Group alpha={0.5} angle={-10}>
        <Text x={20} y={100} text="This some text" color="white" />
        <Text x={20} y={150} text="This is some more text" color="white" />
      </Group>
    </Scene>
  </Game>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={Group} />
